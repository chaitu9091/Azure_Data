RCM is the process that hospitals use to manage the financial aspects, from the time patient schedules an appointment 
till the time doctor gets paid

5000 Patient

2) Service are provided 
3) Billing Happens : The hospital will create the bill
4) Claims are reviewed : Insurance company review the bill
5) Payments and follow ups
